##Learning how to build React Native Apps

#Exercise in UI and UX design
##Built this following a tutorial by {JS} Mastery -- LINK -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ivIUCSOZ78
  
#Awesome Experiance
##Learning React Native was pretty easy, many of the concepts were the same as React.js so it was easy to grasp.
  
##Loved learning this style of React! 
  
##I'm pretty fired up about building apps, and look forward to building some on my own!!
